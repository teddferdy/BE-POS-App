# BE-POS-App — demo container runtime (Render Free + Neon Postgres)
#
# This Dockerfile targets a traditional always-on Node process, NOT Vercel's
# serverless model. api/index.js already branches its own bootstrap on
# `process.env.VERCEL` — Render never sets that variable, so running this
# image on Render activates Socket.IO, the four in-process schedulers, and
# graceful shutdown automatically, with ZERO code changes required. See
# PHASE 6D-0 report for the evidence trail; do not "helpfully" remove that
# guard here — it already does the right thing for this runtime.
#
# Deliberately excluded from this image: no `sequelize-cli db:migrate` step
# (see P6-06 — the historical migration chain is not bootstrap-safe against a
# fresh database) and no reliance on a durable local filesystem (Render Free's
# container disk is ephemeral across deploys/restarts — fine for transient
# work like generated invoice PDFs, NOT a backup destination).
